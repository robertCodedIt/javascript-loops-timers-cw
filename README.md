# JavaScript Loops and Timer Events - Classwork


### Timer Challenge:
Animate the included sprite images of 'guy' images. Start with an initial image of `guy1.png` then every .5 second (500 ms) update the image to the next one in sequence. Once you reach image `guy9.png` start over with the `guy1.png` image.

### SUPER MARIO Challenge:
Animate Mario walking to the left and right by pressing the left and right arrow keys (HINT: implement event handler(s) for handling the key presses)
